This Codius Node.js build is based on Node.js' 0.12 branch, commit 0d357fa135dedaae644d73b0b9a907b90c66f200.

Implementation differences:
- No libuv
- The uv_loop_t in Environment is replaced with a new EventLoop class which
  replaces a few libuv methods that we still need.
- Instead of doing I/O direct via libuv, this implementation interacts via two
  IPC channels on file descriptors 3 and 4.
- Asynchronous calls are made via JSON messages on FD 3
- Synchronous calls are made via JSON messages on FD 4

API differences:
- Can't spawn child processes
- No --debug
- No process._startProfilerIdleNotifier and process._stopProfilerIdleNotifier
- process.umask() is a noop and always returns 2
- process.kill() is a noop
- No process.hrtime()
- No native extensions (process.dlopen() is disabled)
- No process._setupDomainUse
- Timeout parameter doesn't do anything in vm.runInNewContext / vm.runInThisContext
- No net.isIP
- No TCP socket support
- No domains
